# Certificates
This repo consists of all the certificates (major and minor) achieved by me in college life.

This is a collection and validation of all my work during my college days. The time of Lockdown helped me a lot to pursue different set of skills. I would never forget those days which taught me to constantly keep trying to hit back and forth, researching, failing, trying. Even today, I keep these skills in my mind.

Thank you for giving you time.
